# Search and Date Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Search Functionality Not Working for Company Names
**Problem**: Search was only looking in application notes, not in job fields like company, title, location.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `getApplicationsWithFilters` in `mongodb-service.ts`
- Now searches in both application notes AND job fields (title, company, location, description)
- Uses MongoDB aggregation to find matching jobs first, then includes those in the search query

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Only searched notes
query.$or = [
  { notes: { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } }
];

// After: Searches both notes and job fields
const matchingJobs = await Job.find({
  $or: [
    { title: { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } },
    { company: { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } },
    { location: { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } },
    { description: { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } }
  ]
}).select('_id');

query.$or = [
  { notes: { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } },
  { jobId: { $in: jobIds } }
];
```

### 2. Date Issue (Date 18 becomes Date 17)
**Problem**: Timezone handling causing dates to shift by one day.

**Solution**: 
- Improved date parsing in applications API
- Fixed date field mapping in MongoDB service
- Changed `appliedDate` to use proper date field instead of `datePosted`

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Fixed in mongodb-service.ts
appliedDate: appData.appliedDate ? new Date(appData.appliedDate) : new Date(),

// Fixed import statements
import Job from '../models/Job';
import Application from '../models/Application';
```

## Testing

### Search Functionality
Now you should be able to search for:
- ✅ Company names (e.g., "Capgemini", "Google")
- ✅ Job titles (e.g., "MERN Developer", "Frontend")
- ✅ Locations (e.g., "Kolkata", "Remote")
- ✅ Job descriptions (any text in description)
- ✅ Application notes (existing functionality)

### Date Handling
- ✅ Dates should now be saved correctly without timezone shifts
- ✅ Date picker selections should match saved dates

## Next Steps
1. Test search functionality with company names
2. Test date picker to ensure dates are saved correctly
3. Verify all search types work (title, location, description, notes)
