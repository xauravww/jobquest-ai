# Telegram Commands Fix & Fleeting Notes Implementation

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Telegram Commands Not Working
**Problem**: Commands like `/start`, `/status`, `/reminders`, `/interviews`, `/followups`, `/help` were not being processed properly.

**Root Cause**: The Telegram webhook was not routing slash commands correctly - it was only handling special text formats like `fleeting:` but not actual commands.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper command routing in `src/app/api/telegram/webhook/route.ts`
- Created `handleCommand()` function to process all slash commands
- Commands now work with proper API calls to fetch real data

### 2. Missing Fleeting Notes Page
**Problem**: No dedicated page for managing fleeting notes with pagination and full CRUD operations.

**Solution**:
- Created `src/app/fleeting-notes/page.tsx` with full-featured interface
- Added pagination (10 notes per page)
- Implemented search and filtering (by source, archived status)
- Added full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Archive)
- Enhanced API with PUT endpoint for updates
- Added navigation link in sidebar

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test Telegram Commands:
1. **Configure Telegram** (if not already done):
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   telegramService.quickSetup('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN', 'YOUR_CHAT_ID');
   ```

2. **Send commands to your bot**:
   - `/start` - Should show welcome message
   - `/status` - Should show real statistics
   - `/reminders` - Should list actual reminders
   - `/interviews` - Should list upcoming interviews
   - `/followups` - Should list pending follow-ups
   - `/help` - Should show all commands

3. **Test text commands**:
   - `fleeting: This is a test note from Telegram`
   - `reminder: Test reminder | tomorrow | 2pm`

### Test Fleeting Notes Page:
1. **Navigate to** `/fleeting-notes`
2. **Add notes** with tags
3. **Test search** functionality
4. **Try filtering** by source
5. **Edit and delete** notes
6. **Test pagination** (add 10+ notes)

## 🔍 Debugging

If commands still don't work:

1. **Check webhook setup**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"url":"https://your-domain.com/api/telegram/webhook"}'
   ```

2. **Check console logs** when testing:
   - Look for `🟦 [TELEGRAM WEBHOOK]` messages
   - Verify command processing logs

3. **Test API endpoints directly**:
   - `/api/dashboard/stats`
   - `/api/reminders`
   - `/api/follow-ups`
